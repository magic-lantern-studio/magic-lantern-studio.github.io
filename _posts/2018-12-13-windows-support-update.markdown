# Windows 32-bit Platform Support

Support for the Windows 32-bit platform has been updated to reflect changes required by Linux. Work continues on bringing up some titles to demonstrate the SDK and runtime engine.

# Windows 64-bit Platform Support

Updating the Windows 64-bit platform is also underway. Should be completed before the end-of-year.
